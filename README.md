**🟣 Rust is a strong-typed (you can't work around the type system, like Python) and static-typed language (the type is known at the compile time, like C), designed to guide developers towards reliable and efficient code in terms of speed, memory usage, and security.**

**🟪 in this project, we learn Rust the right way: by tackling classical algorithms and data structures problems.**
